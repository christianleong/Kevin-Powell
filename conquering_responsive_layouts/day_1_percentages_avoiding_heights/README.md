### Key takeaways
1. Width 
    1. Kevin discussed about the benefits of using percentages `%` to set width instead of `px`.
    1. By default, divs are automatically set to 100% of the width of the body/viewport. But by giving it a set width in `px`, we don't allow it to be responsive.
    1. This becomes an issue if we set the width of the child as `px` as well, which leads to overflowing.
2.  Height
    1. If we set a height with `px`, this can also lead to text in the div overflowing.
    1. Hence, it's better to leave it out and let it be responsive.
